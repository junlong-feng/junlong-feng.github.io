Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research field is econometric theory, with particular interests in nonparametric identification, high dimensional panel data methods, quantile regression, inferential methods for nonlinear models, causal inference and machine learning.

I received my Ph.D in Economics from Columbia University in 2020.
