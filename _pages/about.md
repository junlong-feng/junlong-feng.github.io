Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I specialize in econometrics, focusing on nonparametric identification and estimation, causal inference, and high dimensional data.

I earned my Ph.D in Economics from Columbia University and Bachelor of Economics & B.A in Mathematics from Renmin University of China.
