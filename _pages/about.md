Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I'm an econometrician with research interests in nonparametric identification, inferential methods for nonlinear models, high dimensional panel data methods, quantile regression, causal inference and machine learning.

I earned my Ph.D in Economics from Columbia University and Bachelor of Economics & B.A in Mathematics from Renmin University of China. You can download a PDF copy of my CV [here](/files/cv_jfeng-1.pdf).
